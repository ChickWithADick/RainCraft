 * Requires Forge for MC 1.12.2

#### !!Important!! ####

If you are experienceing lag issues, try removing the chunk-preloader mod, it doesn't have perfectly compatibility w/ optifine so removing it may fix the issue for you. The-chunk preloader mod is mainly used server side so it shouldn't effect anything if you remove it.

## Changelog:

## The Optimization Update: 4-25-20 
 * Heavy server optimizations + modpack optimizations
 * Added Questionably Immersive
 * A pretty decent if slightly jenk autobackup system is now in place, the world will get backedup every two days.

## The Builders Update: 3-25-20
* added Better Builder's wands and effortless building for ease of building
* removed chunk pregen from client packs to hopefully solve some lag issues

### Third Revision: The Lightpack Update 3-11-20
Completly reworked modpack made to be extra light so hopefully anyone with bad internet or a bad computer can play. Note the pack will take a bit to load to the fact intercompatbility requires forge to load the mods in stages, not because there is a lot of mods. You should be able to play comfortably with at least 6 gigs of ram. 

### Massive Update! 2-19-20
I'm to lazy to list all the changes there's like 70 additions and 10 removals, a regenerated world, a better spawn, pregenerated chunks to drastically cut down on server lag, and better compatability between mods, more  what do you want from me.

## Changelog:

### Third Revision: The Lightpack Update 3-11-20
Completly reworked modpack made to be extra light so hopefully anyone with bad internet or a bad computer can play. Note the pack will take a bit to load to the fact intercompatbility requires forge to load the mods in stages, not because there is a lot of mods. You should be able to play comfortably with at least 6 gigs of ram. 

### Massive Update! 2-19-20
I'm to lazy to list all the changes there's like 70 additions and 10 removals, a regenerated world, a better spawn, pregenerated chunks to drastically cut down on server lag, and better compatability between mods, more  what do you want from me.
